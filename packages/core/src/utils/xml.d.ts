 * Escape text so it is safe to interpolate into an XML element body OR

 * `"`, `'`) so callers can't pick a context-incomplete subset by
 * accident — a future caller using `attr="${escapeXml(input)}"` would
 * otherwise be vulnerable to attribute injection through unescaped `"`.
 *
 * Used wherever model-facing prompts wrap user / extension / MCP-
 * supplied strings in tags (`<available_skills>`, `<task-notification>`,
 * `<system-reminder>`, etc.) — without escaping, a value containing
 * one of the metacharacters could close the envelope early and forge
 * sibling tags that the model would treat as trusted metadata.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no allocation beyond the string replacement chain.
